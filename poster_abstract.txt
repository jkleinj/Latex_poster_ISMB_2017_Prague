Modelling Transcriptomics Data of the Developing Enteric Nervous System
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
The Enteric Nervous System (ENS) comprises in the order of 10^8 cells that
perform sensory functions, control intestinal muscle movement and regulate
enzyme secretion. The ENS develops from neural crest cell progenitors that
proliferate and differentiate to glia and neurons along with the expansion
of the gastrointestinal tract during development.
This spatio-temporal self-organisation of the ENS to form a functional
neural network despite a seemingly disordered distribution of neurons is
only marginally understood.
Using transcriptomics, in particular single-cell RNA-Seq data, of enteric
cells at several developmental time points, we have studied their
transcriptomic variability and characterised the cellular states
(e.g. glial and neuronal) by means of marker genes.
The cross-sectional time series was further investigated by latent vaiable analysis,
where the latent variable was either a biological process (like 'cell cycle')
or the internal developmental time modeled as a 'pseudotime'.
Pseudotime estimation was performed by means of Gaussian Process Latent
Variable Modelling on the most divergent genes. The model has yielded
ordering of single cells along the developmental pseudotime line and
accordingly expression profiles of genes that correlate with lineage
development in the ENS. The Bayesian model provides not only the most likely
posterior distribution, but also the associated uncertanties of the estimates.
